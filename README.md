# weather-reports
## Description

My motivation for this project was to build a weather website that displays temperature, wind, humidity, and the UV index. Constructing a weather website is helpful for many coders as it is a typical interview project. This project helped me learn more about JavaScript and APIs. I built this project to test my JavaScript and API skills. One of the major struggles I had with the weather website was getting the APIs to work properly. It took a lot of reading and watching YouTube tutorials. I feel accomplished that I finally finished this project after it took me so long.
